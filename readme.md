**AMM**
Automated market makers (AMMs) allow digital assets to be traded without permission and automatically by using liquidity pools instead of a traditional market of buyers and sellers. On a traditional exchange platform, buyers and sellers offer up different prices for an asset.

**Method**
AMMs have become a primary way to trade assets in the DeFi ecosystem, and it all began with a blog post about “on-chain market makers” by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. The secret ingredient of AMMs is a simple mathematical formula that can take many forms. The most common one was proposed by Vitalik as:

tokenA_balance(p) * tokenB_balance(p) = k

**Players**
The DeFi ecosystem evolves quickly, but three dominant AMM models have emerged: Uniswap, Curve, and Balancer.

Uniswap’s pioneering technology allows users to create a liquidity pool with any pair of ERC-20 tokens with a 50/50 ratio, and has become the most enduring AMM model on Ethereum. 

Curve specializes in creating liquidity pools of similar assets such as stablecoins, and as a result, offers some of the lowest rates and most efficient trades in the industry while solving the problem of limited liquidity. 

Balancer stretches the limits of Uniswap by allowing users to create dynamic liquidity pools of up to eight different assets in any ratio, thus expanding AMMs’ flexibility.
